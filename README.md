# Chest_Xray_Federated_Learning

The Chest X-ray Federated Learning project is a Python-based implementation of federated learning techniques applied to chest X-ray images. It aims to enable collaborative learning across multiple healthcare institutions while preserving data privacy. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, and other important details.

## Features

### Federated Learning: 
The project implements federated learning techniques, allowing multiple healthcare institutions to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data.

### Chest X-ray Dataset:
The project utilizes a chest X-ray dataset, which includes a collection of chest X-ray images and their corresponding labels.

### Client-Server Architecture:
The federated learning system follows a client-server architecture, where a central server coordinates the training process, and clients (healthcare institutions) contribute to model training using their local data.

### Privacy Preservation:
The project ensures data privacy by using techniques like federated averaging, secure aggregation, or differential privacy to protect sensitive patient information during the federated learning process.

### Model Evaluation:
The implementation includes evaluation mechanisms to assess the performance of the trained models using validation datasets.

### Model Aggregation:
The central server aggregates model updates from clients to create a global model, leveraging techniques like federated averaging to combine the local models effectively.
